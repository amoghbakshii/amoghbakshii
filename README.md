About Me
I'm a passionate and driven full-stack developer with a knack for turning complex problems into elegant, efficient, and scalable solutions. My journey in tech is fueled by a desire to build products that not only work flawlessly but also have a tangible, positive impact. I am currently honing my skills in web development and AI at Christ University, and I am actively seeking a Software Development Engineer internship where I can contribute to building the future, one line of code at a time.

👨‍💻 Role: Web Development Intern at Sedna Infosystems, where I engineered responsive frontends and robust backends for client projects.

🤖 AI Enthusiast: I love exploring the potential of AI and have built tools using the Gemini 2.0 LLM to automate tasks like email summarization.

🚀 Driven by Impact: I thrive in fast-paced environments and am committed to writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

🎓 Education: Pursuing a BCA (Hons.) at Christ University, Delhi NCR (Expected 2026).
